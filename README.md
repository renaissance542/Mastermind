Code-breaking game

This game is a chance to practice coding with Ruby.  It is an assignment as part of The Odin Project (ToP).  No code was provided, all of it is my own.

The first part of the game is where the computer generates a secret code and the player tries to guess the code.  The most complex thing to do was generate appropriate feedback for the player after each guess.

The second part of the game is to have the computer guess a secret code that the player chooses.  This was much more difficult, as I wanted to have the computer guess using both strategy and randomness, as a person would.  

As stands the computer is usually able to guess the code in fewer than 12 guesses, but can take longer.  There are still a couple logical improvements possible, which I left in as comments and might update in a future version.
